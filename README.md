# Shortcode Options
WordPress uses options to store a wide range of preferences and configuration settings. These options are essential for WordPress to function smoothly. By default, WordPress installs come with a set of predefined options that are used to manage various aspects of the site.

If you want to easily display WordPress options on your site, the WP Options Shortcode plugin can help. With this plugin, you can display WP Options using shortcodes, making it easy to showcase important information on your website.

To use the plugin, simply insert the shortcode `[wpoption opt=”blogname”]` wherever you want the option to appear. You can customize the shortcode to display any option you need, such as the site URL or the number of posts per page.

The WP Options Shortcode plugin offers a simple and efficient way to display WordPress options on your site. With this plugin, you can easily access important information without having to navigate through the WordPress backend.

Options are pieces of data that WordPress uses to store various preferences and configuration settings. Listed below are the options, along with some of the default values from the current WordPress install ([Reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Option_Reference)).
